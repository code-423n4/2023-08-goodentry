Hi @NicoDeva I've sent you a friend request 🤗 if you are brave enough to accept it I'll have a question for you. TY!

Hi, I am a newbie in code4rena. can you explain the audit process please?


[08/02/2023 06:12] _3doc_
Welcome @Tough you can find in the link below the introduction info for wardens. 

You can use the #❓questions and #🐺wardens for questions related to Code4rena and the warden role & process, while in this channel the conversation is mostly related to the GoodEntry audit (design, codebase, ...)

@NicoDeva I noticed the contracts in lib are out of scope. Yet they are imported and used in the core contracts so any error in the libs would break the core contracts. Should they not also be considered in scope then?


[08/02/2023 07:58] beirao
These lib contracts are fork from Uniswap. They may be out of scope for this.


[08/02/2023 07:59] 14si2o_flint
Yeah they are noted out of scope. I'm questioning whether they should be out of scope 😁

If you see something wrong in these contracts you should then go check the Uniswap bug bounty you will earn much more 😂

[08/02/2023 08:23] 0x11singh99
@NicoDeva  Does the previous audits findings by PeckShield and Protofire  has been fixed Or not in this protocol code listed on code4rena ??
They audited  deployed contracts Or these listed contracts are also audited ??


[08/02/2023 08:30] bytes032
usually any findings from previous reports are considered known issues


[08/02/2023 08:31] nicodeva
Contracts in lib/ are external contracts copied in the repo, from Uniswap. They're out of scope.
Audits issues have been fixed.

ie. code listed on c4 now is already audited  Or those audits were about your previusly deployed contracts,,,or the code listed on c4 is live also ??


[08/02/2023 09:21] sath26
why is it stuck in 30% for more than 15 mins

[08/02/2023 10:47] nicodeva
it shouldnt, most likely the geth fork is stuck downloading some of the tree state
Happens to me sometime, especially the coverage mode
you can also try replacing the fork RPC address with your own Alchemy or Infura address (can create one for free), I haven't seen any notification from alchemy but maybe too many simultaneous requests are being rate limited.

code deployed is audited, except from addDust fnc in OptionsPM

@NicoDeva Tests are too slow, what is your brownie configuration?

is indeed modified and audited, out of scope though. it allows whitelisted contracts (the OptionPositionManager and the RangeManager) to get user tokens without check under special conditions

https://github.com/GoodEntry-io/GoodEntryMarkets/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol.0x20#L486

PMTransfer allows priviledged transfer of assets to position managers.
This allows handling user assets without having to give allowance to position managers
It also allows easy deleveraging (since can move tokens while there is ongoing debt)
In exchange the PM needs to be secure and return all assets else there could be bad debt. Or another user's assets could be stolen.

So transfers are only allowed if coming from the user moving its own funds (for leveraging/deleveraging purposes, or recreating TR asset), or if the health factor is low and (soft) liquidation is allowed

Do you guys think there are donation attacks possible on the GeVaults?


[08/05/2023 08:59] parsely.
Will look closer, but, my  initial thoughts, when i did a brief check for that was that they were not vulnerable, but will spend more focus on that.

@NicoDeva Once the contest is finished , and if you would like, I am happy to share a reentrancy vulnerability vector, if it is not surfaced by the researchers in the contest. It's in the GeVault. It depends on the Oracle not reverting on a non-existant token (returning 0 price maybe), so my PoC on mainnet failed because it reverted on address(0). But happy to share. (NOT ASKING FOR ANY OUT OF BAND PAYMENT, It's just the right thing to do!) @kartoonjoy @CloudEllie  Please correct me or allow me to share through C4, Please I am by no means trying to get any benefit after the fact or directly from the project, but would be very sad if it was exploited and I did not say anything.

@kutu whenever I see a leader-board I see your name in top 3, do you ever sleep?

Do we have to register to be certified in order to receive payment for this contest?

Hi all! So this was my first time participating. And I am glad that I got placed in the leaderboards (however low it may be),  I wanted to request the top players to answer these few questions I had;
how did you all manage to earn so well and what are the areas I should look at?
knowing so will greatly help me in the future.

Can anyone tell me who was the judge in this contest?

Like 507, 131, …


[10/03/2023 04:33] mike_bello90
thank you


[10/03/2023 04:36] mike_bello90
shouldn't the judge write why a report is marked as invalid?


[10/03/2023 04:37] mike_bello90
I'm trying to understand why a report was rejected and learn from my past submissions


[10/03/2023 04:45] _3doc_
Normally they would, but not sure it’s anything more than a courtesy. Want me to take a guess on a submission?


[10/03/2023 04:48] _3doc_
something that helps a lot is backstage access, so you can ask judges for more info directly (and in time for having them change their mind sometimes)


[10/03/2023 04:56] mike_bello90
if you can give me some feedback in the 507 would be great thanks

will try to get it, but I've been having problems getting verified by the provider of KYC

[10/03/2023 05:16] _3doc_
I think it fails to show a concrete impact for the protocol & its users (other than the obvious impact for the donator).

The only thing that vaguely seems impactful is point 8 (that is why the issue has been marked duplicate of 48, closed with a proper explanation)


[10/03/2023 05:20] _3doc_
IMO a suggestion could be to be brief in explaining the various impacts, and be more rigorous in proving the highest impact (ideally with a runnable PoC in foundry or hardhat). Here you were very detailed in the scenarios but vague on the impact - that in the end is what makes a finding count
